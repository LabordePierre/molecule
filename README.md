# Molecule

![Molecule Logo](MoleculeBanner.jpg)

Molecule is a component oriented framework for Pharo. 
His Component architecture approach provides an adapted structuration to User Interface (UI) or another software application which need Component features.

Molecule provides a way to describe a software application as a component group. Components communicate by use of services, parameters and event propagation. It is a Pharo implementation of the Lightweight Corba Component Model (Lightweight CCM).
Molecule supports completely transparent class augmentation into component (not necessary to add code manually), based on Traits.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install Molecule in your Pharo image you just need to execute the following script:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
   baseline: 'Molecule';
   repository: 'github://OpenSmock/Molecule';
   load.
```

Continuous integration (CI) status badges show status of compatibility for all supported Pharo versions. You can use Molecule with your Pharo version when its badge is green ! 

### Looking for an older Pharo ?

New releases of Molecule don't support old Pharo versions (< 10), but could work.
Find below some Molecule branches for old Pharo versions. 

[Pharo 9 and 10 - last release is 1.2.8](https://github.com/OpenSmock/Molecule/tree/Pharo9-10).

[Pharo 8 - last release is 1.2.7](https://github.com/OpenSmock/Molecule/tree/Pharo8).

[Pharo 6 and 7 - last release is 1.1.1](https://github.com/OpenSmock/Molecule/tree/Pharo6-7).

### Prerequisites

Molecule Core has no dependencies.

Package 'Molecule-Benchmarks' requires SMark (https://github.com/smarr/SMark), this package contains benchmarks for working on performances.

## Molecule Menu

Molecule system can be monitored and controlled from the dedicated `Molecule` library menu.

## Using Components

### Start and stop method

Components can be used with the start & stop method.

To start a component:

```smalltalk
component := MyComponentClass start.
```

To stop a component: 

```smalltalk
MyComponentClass stop.
```

Component can be identified with a name. To start a component with a specific name:

```smalltalk
componentA := MyComponentClass start: #componentA.
```

To stop a component identified by a name:

```smalltalk
MyComponentClass stop: #componentA.
```

### Component life-cycle method

Components can be used with the life-cycle method, the two methods (start & stop, life-cycle) can be combined.

Starting a component is equivalent to:

```smalltalk
MyComponentClass deploy.
component := MyComponentClass instantiate.
MyComponentClass activate.
```

With a name:

```smalltalk
MyComponentClass deploy.
componentA := MyComponentClass instantiate: #compA.
MyComponentClass activate: #compA.
```

Stopping a component is equivalent to:

```smalltalk
MyComponentClass passivate.
MyComponentClass remove.
MyComponentClass undeploy.
```

With a name:

```smalltalk
MyComponentClass passivate: #compA.
MyComponentClass remove: #compA.
MyComponentClass undeploy.
```

## Some examples

Examples are available in the package 'Molecule-Examples'.
Open the Transcript before running examples, some results are showed in the Transcript window.

#### Clock System example

```smalltalk
MolMyClockSystem startAlarmExample.
```

This system uses 4 components: a server time sends global hour to a clock. The clock sends local hour to alarms and to the final user (which could be an UI). The final user can change the parameters of the system as alarm time or set a manual time for the clock. The alarm is subscribed to the clock time, and sounds when it's time.

This system provides a global example of the use of components. 

#### GPS example

```smalltalk
MolGPSExampleLauncher start.
```
Examples are further detailed in the comment of MolGPSExampleLauncher.

First we program a component application that connects to a Global Positioning System (GPS) hardware and displays the GPS data on a view map (just fictitious).
The GPS data and view map are implemented as Molecule components.
In a second way, we reuse an existing non-component class in our Molecule application (MolGPSHardware).
To do so, we augment this class with component behavior.


## Incubator packages: our UI tools experimentation zone

UI Tools are coming in the next versions of Molecule. They are currently in development in incubators packages, are ready to use but may be instable.

### Installing incubators packages:

To install Molecule with incubator packages on your Pharo image you just need to execute the following script:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
   baseline: 'MoleculeIncubator';
   repository: 'github://OpenSmock/Molecule';
   onConflictUseIncoming;
   load.
```
