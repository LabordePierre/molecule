We give an overview of Molecule through two examples :
- Clock System
- GPS

#Clock System
Before running the example open the Transcript, the example results is showed on the Transcript window.

MolMyClockSystem startAlarmExample.

This system uses 4 components: a server time send global hour to a clock. The clock send local hour to alarms and to final user (which could be an UI). The final user can change the parameters of the system as alarm time or set manual time for the clock. The alarm is subscribed to clock time, and sounds when it is time.
This system provides a global example of the use of components.

#GPS
Before running the example open the Transcript, the example results is showed on the Transcript window.

MolGPSExampleLauncher start.
More details about examples in the comment of MolGPSExampleLauncher.

First we program a component application that connects to a Global Positioning System (GPS) hardware and displays the GPS data on a view map (just fictitious). 
The GPS data and view map are implemented as Molecule components.
In a second way, we reuse an existing non-component class in our Molecule application (MolGPSHardware).
To do so, we augment this class with component behavior.
